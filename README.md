# 📚 Data Structures & Algorithms in JavaScript 

Welcome to my DSA repository! This is a personal collection of data structures and algorithms implemented using JavaScript and TypeScript. The goal of this project is to improve problem-solving skills and deepen understanding of core computer science concepts.

## 🧠 What's Inside

This repository includes implementations and test cases for:

### 📦 Data Structures
- Linked Lists
  - Singly Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List
  - Circular Singly Linked List
- Stacks(Coming soon)
- Queues(Coming soon)
- Trees(Coming soon)
  - Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Graphs (Coming soon)
- Hash Tables (Coming soon)

### ⚙️ Algorithms
- Sorting Algorithms(Coming soon)
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort (Coming soon)
  - Quick Sort (Coming soon)
- Searching Algorithms(Coming soon)
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search

## 🧪 Testing

All data structures and algorithms are tested using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm run test
```
